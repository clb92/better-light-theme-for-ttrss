# Better light theme for Tiny Tiny RSS

A better light theme for Tiny Tiny RSS, inspired by the look of [CommaFeed](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed). It's just a few modifications I made so it suits my personal preferences better.

**This theme is made for always expanded articles and 'combined mode' turned on**, otherwise you're not going to see most of the differences.

## Features

- More whitespace around and between articles, so they don't blend together as much
- Set a max width on article content
- Better visible article header and footer
- Feed panel has less whitespace but better text contrast
- In feed panel, the scrollbar is only shown when overing over the panel
- in feed panel the unread count labels are not shown on categories, only on feeds
- In Firefox, the feed panel scrollbar is [thin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-width) (Chrome, *please* support this in the future...)
- *Stylish drop shadows!*

See screenshot comparison below too.

## Installation

1. Copy the `better-light-theme-for-ttrss.css` file into the `themes.local` folder.
2. Select the theme in TT-RSS preferences.

This theme depends on the 'light' theme being installed, but it should be installed by default.
